This is the github evaluation set for FACC.
You should run nix-shell in the base directory of the repository to get the various tools needed for this.

clone.sh clones the repositories, and uses the local extraction scripts to extract the right regions of code to put these into the approrpriate files.
It then runs a makefile in each folder, which builds these into the executables
that FACC needs to run.
Typemaps etc. are already specified.


#Computing IDLCheckDataFFT:
IDLCheckData is a measure of how well IDL does with an FFT pattern.
The first step is to clone IDL (see instructions in Ginsbach 2020).
Second step is to place the FFTIdiom.idl file in-place of the idl
file within IDL.
Third step is to repeatedly run ./idl_check.sh <path to IDL> while
deleteing 10 lines at a time from the ComplexReductionsAndHistograms
pattern that has been modified to match FFTs
