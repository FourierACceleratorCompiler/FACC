FFTFucntion: fft-dit.c:fft
Notes: different typemaps for different targets, so need different iospecs for each one (uses platform-specific vectorization).  This also uses enums, which are just sugar removed by the compiler, so we provide a wrapper to get around that sugar.
Algorithm: Radix 2 DIF
FunctionLine: 79
